# Elo Melee Ranking System
Python script designed to calculate running rankings for a 1-on-1 competitive game, specifically Super Smash Brothers Melee. This program uses the Challonge API to pull tournament results from the web and store matches locally. Elo scores can be generated for any combination of tournaments, with accommodations for player tags and multiple tags per player.
